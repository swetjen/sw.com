        <p>
            As the sole developer I prioritize choosing technology that allows me to ship features quickly. My go-to
            stack for The Bindel included Python, FastAPI, and MongoDB for the backend, and NuxtJs + TypeScript for the
            frontend. The entire project was hosted on <a href="https://digitalocean.com"
                                                          target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> and a simple Bash script was
            used for CI/CD.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the frontend, I chose <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/" target="_blank">NuxtJs</a> due to its
            Server-Side-Generation (SSG) capabilities and familiarity with VueJs. Since Nuxt supports both
            SSG for SEO and a fast Single Page Application (SPA) for users, the best of both worlds can be achieved.
            TypeScript's compile-time safety helps get features working with less trial and error.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the backend, I opted for <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" target="_blank">FastApi</a> and <a
                href="https://mongodb.com" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>. FastAPI's out-of-the-box OpenAPI support made it
            easy to integrate with the frontend. OpenAPI is also very helpful in testing the backend independently of
            the frontend implementation. MongoDB was a clear choice as it allowed us to move quickly without the
            initial effort of defining a strong data model. Later, Mongo's Aggregation Pipeline enabled sensible
            cross-collection &ldquo;joins&rdquo; after patterns in the data began to emerge.

            <h2>Making it fun</h2>
            <p>
                To make the frontend fun and engaging, despite competition from other players with bigger budgets, we focused on keeping the Bindel site simple and enjoyable. One key area that received extra attention was the neighborhood and unit-type picker. To achieve a seamless and enjoyable experience, the navigation menu haphazardly unfolds into a stack of cards, each featuring a neighborhood with a cute icon to entice interest. Similarly, the unit picker works the same way, with slightly bigger cards to help distinguish amenities.

                For the product detail page (PDP), we relied heavily on previously established patterns, as people already know how to shop stays online. Our efforts focused on making the experience blazing fast. Opening the photo gallery is instantaneous, and so is interacting with the rest of the page, calendar, buy-box, and so on.

            <h2>Admin Tools</h2>
            <p>
                The website has a significant amount of admin functionality, which includes managing neighborhoods, unit
                types, and pricing, each with its own dedicated admin interface. However, the most critical admin work
                was focused on the guest experience, specifically handling reservations, move-in and move-out,
                invoicing, and payments. To improve upon Stripe's out-of-the-box functionality, we developed our own
                invoicing tool designed to address the intricacies of the rental industry. Our primary goal was to make
                the process simple and error-proof for the customer-facing staff.
