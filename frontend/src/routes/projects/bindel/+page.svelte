        <h2>What's The Bindel?</h2>
        <p>
            The Bindel is an online rental booking platform for short-term stays in Austin, Texas, offering a fun and
            simple user experience for guests.
        </p>
        <h2>Technology Stack and Implementation Approach</h2>
        <p>
            As a solo developer, I prioritize choosing technology that allows me to quickly ship new features for
            startup projects. My go-to stack for The Bindel included Python, FastAPI, and MongoDB for the backend,
            and NuxtJs + TypeScript for the frontend. The entire project was hosted on DigitalOcean and a simple
            Bash script was used for CI/CD.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the frontend, I chose NuxtJs due to its SSG capabilities and my previous experience with VueJs. Nuxt
            supports both Server-Side-Generation (SSG) for SEO and a fast Single Page Application (SPA)
            for users. TypeScript's compile-time safety helps get features working with less trial and error.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the backend, I opted for FastAPI and MongoDB. FastAPI's out-of-the-box OpenAPI support made it easy
            to integrate with the frontend. MongoDB was a clear choice as it allowed us to move quickly without the
            initial effort of defining a strong data model. Its aggregation queries also enabled sensible
            cross-collection joins when necessary.

            <h2>Making it fun</h2>
            <p>
                To make the frontend fun and engaging, despite competition from bigger players with millions in funding,
                we focused on keeping the Bindel site simple and enjoyable. One key area that received extra attention was
                the neighborhood and unit-type picker. To achieve a seamless and enjoyable experience, the navigation menu
                haphazardly unfolds into a stack of cards, each featuring a neighborhood with a cute icon to entice
                interest. Similarly, the locations work the same way, with slightly bigger cards to distinguish between
                the unit's amenities.

                For the PDP, we relied heavily on previously established patterns, as people already know how to shop
                stays online. Our efforts focused on making the experience blazing fast. Opening the photo gallery is
                instantaneous, and interacting with the rest of the page, calendar, and so on, is just as quick.

            <h2>Admin Tools</h2>
            <p>
                The website has a significant amount of admin functionality, which includes managing neighborhoods, unit
                types, and pricing, each with its own dedicated admin interface. However, the most critical admin work
                was focused on the guest experience, specifically handling reservations, move-in and move-out,
                invoicing, and payments. To improve upon Stripe's out-of-the-box functionality, we developed our own
                invoicing tool, designed to address the intricacies of the rental industry. Our primary goal was to make
                the process simple and error-proof for the customer-facing staff.
