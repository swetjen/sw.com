            <p>
                Hi, I'm Spence Wetjen - a full-stack developer and UX designer based in Austin, Texas, USA. With 15
                years of experience in the e-commerce, software-as-a-service, and web industries, I have had the
                privilege of working with some of the world's leading organizations such as Microsoft, Google, Apple,
                Best Buy, and Cisco.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, I have worked on both large and small projects, gaining extensive experience across a
                variety of project types and working with teams of various sizes, each with their own constraints and
                goals. Most of my projects involve new product development, technology updates, user experience
                refreshes, and web service integrations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I apply my experience to help teams launch their products quickly. My background frequently
                helps to guide teams towards success while avoiding unexpected issues. Throughout the design and
                development process, I prioritize clear goals, communication, user-centered-design, rapid prototyping,
                and collaboration.
            </p>
